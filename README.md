## IMPRES codes


## System requirements: 
MATLAB has to be installed. 
Version checked on: MATLAB 2014b, MATLAB 2017b and MATLAB 2018a.
OS tested: mac OS 10.12.6 ans 10.10.5
Typical running time: excluding hilClibming.m, all codes run in a few
minutes or less. 
hilClibming.m - requires a long running time (typically 4-6 hours), and is
commented in MAIN_CODES->Feature_selection->PART1 (line 13 with a warning  
for the required running time), its output (RES.mat) is saved in the directory and 
is ready



## MAIN_CODES: Main codes for IMPRES
Feature selection: Feature selection and construction of IMPRES score 
using neuroblastoma data (run PART1.m)

Melanoma Prediction: Predict immune response based on IMPRES score
defined in PART1 (calculated on melanoma data, as is) for 9 datasets
from 6 publicly available studies (run PART2.m)

Survival analysis: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using IMPRES score
for ICB treated patients and comparison of PFS between samples with high/low 
IMPRES scores for data with annotations of PFS (run PART3.m)

ADDITIONAL_CODES: Additional codes and analyses
